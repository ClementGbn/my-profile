	<h2>Associative life</h2>
		<p>
			I have some associative life throughout Iéseg outside classes. I’m currently in the association La Capsule, which is the one organizing conferences every semesters around themes related to general culture. But it is also about organizing several other events, which can be anything really.

	<h2>Exchanges</h2>
		<p>
			Concerning my exchanges, I would certainly like to do one, but during the third year. I would like to go to an Asian country, something like Japan or Korea.
